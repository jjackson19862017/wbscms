# Wedding Booking System

## Setup & Equipment

### Server / Hosting

This was created using a Digital Ocean Droplet, setup with a Laravel 7 package.

This was setup on an iPhone 11, in a barbers while i waited for my turn using Safari.  Once the droplet was created using an app called TERMIUS.  This granted me CLI access to it, I used the linux terminal to update and upgrade the server.

My first issue was that I have been learning Laravel version 8, so I researched how to update to version 8.   

I have also installed a ui addon pack with bootstrap as well with 'composer require laravel/ui && php artisan ui bootstrap --auth && npm install && npm run dev'

I am also using an app called Koder on my iPad to write this document.
